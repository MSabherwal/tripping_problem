#Tripping Interview Problem

##Running the code
code written with ruby 2.1.4

To run the code without a range of values:
	ruby tripping.rb

If you want to determine if a range of dates are valid:
	ruby tripping.rb -r 2015-03-07,2015-03-10

You can change the seed json file to try against using:
	ruby tripping.rb -f PATH_TO_FILE

These options can be seen by passing -h
	ruby tripping.rb -h
